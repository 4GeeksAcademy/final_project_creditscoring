    "After reviewing the missingno matrix, we performed a final audit to capture residual data leakage that bypassed our initial classification rules. Additionally, we identified a group of variables introduced by Lending Club in late 2015 (such as il_util and open_acc_6m). Since these features are missing in over 80% of our historical records, their inclusion would introduce a historical cohort bias. To ensure model stability and prevent the Logistic Regression from learning patterns based on data availability periods rather than credit risk, we decided to remove them."

    "The missingno matrix confirms that data is missing in logical patterns rather than randomly. We identified two main types of missingness:\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural (Informative): Columns like mths_since_last_delinq (55-88% missing) represent borrowers with no negative credit events. These are informative nulls that we will preserve and impute with a sentinel value (999).\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical Blocks: A significant block of features (30% missing) fails simultaneously. The Heatmap shows 1.0 correlations between these nulls, proving they are record-level gaps from the credit bureau.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: The high correlation between missing values confirms that data fails in blocks. This justifies a consistent strategy: median imputation for technical blocks and sentinel values (999) for structural features, ensuring the model captures both the presence and absence of credit history correctly."

    "Instead of a standard random shuffle, we implemented a Temporal Split based on the loan issuance date (issue_d). We sorted the data chronologically and used the first 80% of the records (2010–2015) for training, while reserving the most recent 20% (2016–2018) as an Out-of-Time (OOT) test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rational: In credit risk modeling, it is vital to ensure the model can generalize to future economic conditions. A temporal split is the most realistic evaluation method because it prevents Look-ahead Bias (training on future information to predict the past). Our results show that the default rate increased from 17% in the training period to 25.4% in the test period. This shift represents a real-world challenge: the model must be robust enough to maintain predictive power even when the macroeconomic environment or borrower profiles evolve over time."
